    Hello, here you find a short introduction to what soastreamer is and
    how to use it.
    
    Soastreamer is a minimal audio and video streaming solution written
    in plain C using the gnome liberies, mainly gstreamer.
    The idea is to have the program running on a computer that is
    connected to either a camera or microphone and then stream the data to
    the network to a number of ip addresses. The program is controlled by
    sending udp commands to it.
    
    Example setup:
                              
       -----commands------------ COMPUTER A
       |                        (udp_client) 
       v    
    COMPUTER B                                                 COMPUTER C
    (soa_videostreamer) -------------udp-------------------> (media player)
                            |
                            ---------udp------------------->   COMPUTER D
                                                             (media player)

    How to compile?
    
    On an Ubuntu, you should have the gstreamer dev packages installed as
    well as the gstreamer good plugins (for the multiudpsink element).
    Then in the audio / video directory run 'make' to build the program.
    
    For sending commands via udp to the streaming program, you probably
    also want to build the 'udp_client' in the 'network' directory.

    Usage
    
    Video:
    Connect an supported USB camera to the computer and then run the
    'soa_videostreamer' program. (By default, the video0 device will be used
    for streaming). As parameter pass any portnumber you want to use for
    receiving commands.
    Then start the 'udp_client' program with localhost and the portnumber
    you used above as parameters. Now you should be able to send commands
    to the streamer:
    
       * add				 <hostname:port>
       * remove			 <hostname:port>
       * set_clients <hostname:port,hostname:port,...>
       * clear    	 -
       * print			 -
       * exit
       
    Audio:
    same as above
